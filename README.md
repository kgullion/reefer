A rusty crate for sailing the seas of Geometric Algebra.

## Install
Reefer is currently not published on crates.io. You can add the following to your `Cargo.toml` dependencies to try it out:
```toml
[dependencies]
reefer = { git = "https://github.com/kgullion/reefer", branch = "main" }
```

## Usage
See `tests/lorentz.rs` and `tests/pga2d.rs` for current examples.

Uncomment the `println!` at `src/lib.rs:L51-58` and run
`cargo test -- --nocapture` to see the pretty-printed generated code.
Note: you may need to also change the file in test to invalidate any build caching. Just saving or adding a space is enough.
